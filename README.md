# SGRecoveryLitSynthesis
Quantitative literature synthesis of disturbance and recovery dynamics in seagrass ecosystems

## Background

Prior experimental and observational studies measured the aboveground recovery rate of seagrass following a disturbance event. These studies of disturbance/recovery dynamics are geographically extensive, occur in mono- and mixed beds, and across depth gradients. Despite the breadth of seagrass disturbance/recovery studies, there has been little cross-system examination of the resulting patterns or generalizations regarding the recovery of seagrass ecosystems.

## Objectives

I am systematically review and synthesize the available primary literature on seagrass ecosystem disturbance and recovery to:
1) determine the primary drivers of disturbance within seagrass ecosystems
2) identify drivers and patterns of recovery within seagrass ecosystems
3) provide a general, first-order quantitative model of seagrass recovery rates for ecosystem management.
